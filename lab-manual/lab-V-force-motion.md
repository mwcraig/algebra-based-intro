- Relationship between force and motion (Newton's Second Law)

### Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Draw a picture of a cart traveling down an inclined track.

- Draw a schematic diagram labeling the forces on the cart

Draw a picture of a cart traveling along a flat track being pulled by a string (force)

- Draw a schematic diagram labeling the forces on the cart

Explorations:

- Imagine you are on a cart being pulled. You have hold of one end of the rope and your friend (the puller) is holding the other end of the rope.
  - You are stationary (you have your feet down). Is the force you exert on the rope greater than, less than or equal to your friend's force?
  - You are moving (you lifted your feet off the ground). Is the force you exert on the rope greater than, less than or equal to your friend's force?
  - (Do DURING Lab) Set up and calibrate the force sensors to check your answers.

### Basic Lab (B-level)

Attach a force probe to a cart on a flat track and connect a string to the force probe. Pass the string over a pulley on the end of the track and connect it to a mass hanger. The falling mass will pull the cart down the track.

- You will determine how force affects motion by varying the mass that is pulling the cart. Eventually, you want to create a single plot which shows cart acceleration as a function of pulling force.
  - What quantity should be on the vertical axis? On the horizontal?
  - How will you measure each quantity (and their uncertainties) that you will put on the horizontal and vertical axes?
  - How many data points do you need for a good plot? Why?
  - Carry out your experiment and produce your plot!

NOTES: You are required to include a schematic diagram with force vectors as part of your summary. Also, be sure that the hanging mass is NOT swinging as it falls.

### Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-level) (Choose ONE)

- What happens if the cart mass increases but the pulling force is constant?
- How does the force pulling on the cart compare with the weight of the masses hanging off of the side? Use Newton's 2nd Law to explain your observations.
- Propose and carry out an experiment on something you are curious about (get your lab instructor's approval first
