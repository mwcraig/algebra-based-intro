# Work and Energy


### Additional Equipment

- Springs, string, masses, pulleys and assorted stands

### Objective

Data collection

- Set up appropriate experiment to measure force on and motion of a cart 

Lab Skills

- 
  - Uncertainty propagation
  - Measurement Precision

- Significant Figures
- Agreement in measurements based on uncertainty

- Graph potential and kinetic energy of cart

- Finding the area under a curve
- Determine work and relate to change in energy

Physics Concepts

- Work equals the change in Energy

### Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Draw a picture of a cart that is given a brief push so it travels up and then down an inclined track.

- Draw a schematic diagram with the forces labeled during and after the push
- Sketch plots of the kinetic, gravitational potential, and total energies of the cart as functions of time for the time period after the push.
- Find an equation for the change in gravitational energy as a function of the distance the cart has traveled along the track. HINT: first find the height of the car as a function of the distance it has moved along the track.

### Basic Lab (B-level)

Incline the track with the motion detector at the top. Setup the cart so that you can push on a force probe to send the cart up the incline.

- Graph the potential, kinetic and total energy (on the same plot!) of the cart as a function of time. To do this, you will need to add some calculated columns (Remember Lab 1?)
- Graph the force as a function of distance. Determine the area under the curve for this function while you were pushing on the cart. Compare to the change in energy. As always, be sure to explain your results and include uncertainties.

### Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-level) (Choose ONE)

- Setup a pulley system to lift an object with less than ¼ the objects gravitational weight. 
  - Find the force needed to lift a given mass with and without your pulley system
  - Energy required to lift the mass (to a certain height) without the pulley system
  - Energy required by pulley system to lift the mass (to the same height)

- Hook your cart to a spring (on your inclined track) so it oscillates. 
  - Graph kinetic, spring potential, gravitational potential and total energies. Is the total energy conserved?
  - If you get an unexpected result, investigate the spring potential energy plot. You may wish to compare it to a force vs position plot. How should these two plots be related, and does your data show this relation?

- Propose and carry out an experiment on something you are curious about (get your lab instructor's approval first).
