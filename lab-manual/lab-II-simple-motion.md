Physics Concepts

- Understand the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration
- Interpret plots of position, velocity, and acceleration for a variety of motions

## Conceptual (C-level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Imagine you are watching someone bike down the street at a constant rate.

- Describe in words the velocity and position as a function of time for the bike.
- Draw graphs of both the position and velocity as a function of time for the bike.
- Test your solution using the on-line simulation ("Moving Man") http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/moving-man

**Simulation:**

- Can you create a "W" in the position vs time graph? How do you have to move the man? Use words such as "speed up", "slow down", "constant speed", "turn around", etc.
- Can you create a "W" in the velocity vs time graph? How do you have to move the man?

**Explorations (Done In Lab):**

- Use the motion detector to plot your movements, try to create a "W" in the position vs time plot. 
- Try to make your position vs time plot look like the letter "N". Is there a part of the letter that is difficult? What type of motion is needed to produce this part of the letter?

## Basic Lab (B-level)

- For at least two different speeds, graph the position as a function of time and velocity as a function of time for the cart on a flat track (this means 4 plots!) by giving the cart a brief push and letting go.
- Clearly mark on your graph when you are touching the object. The region of interest (ROI) is the time when you are not touching the object.
- What is the shape of the position as a function of time curve for an object moving horizontally (with no outside pushes)? Compare to the shape of the velocity vs. time curves.
- What property of the position vs time plot should the average value of the velocity plot match up with? Compare these two values. Remember from Lab 1, by "compare" we mean "check if two results agree within each other's uncertainty".
- For at least two different inclines, graph the position as a function of time and velocity as a function of time for a cart moving on the inclined track. 
- Clearly mark on your graph when you are touching the object.
- Compare these plots to the ones where the cart was on the flat track, and note any differences.
- What property of the velocity vs time plot should the average value of the acceleration plot match up with? Compare these two values.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-level) (Choose ONE)

Note: An advanced lab includes a quantitative component with error analysis. The exact question(s) explored is your choice but it should relate to the basic lab.

- Use the "integration" feature to find the area under curve in some region of your acceleration plot. 
    - What are the units of this area? Explain why the area has these units.
    - What property of the velocity plot should the area match up with? Compare these two values, and do this for at least 5 regions!

- Use the "integration" feature to find the area under curve in some region of your velocity plot. 
    - What are the units of this area? Explain why the area has these units.
    - What property of the position plot should the area match up with? Compare these two values, and do this for at least 5 regions!

- Vary the angle of the track and graph the position and velocity of the cart as a function of time. Try this for a variety of angles. Do you notice a pattern? 
- Looking at your plots, when can you tell when something is pushing the object? What evidence do you have for an external "push" for an object not moving horizontally?
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious about (get your lab instructor's approval first).
